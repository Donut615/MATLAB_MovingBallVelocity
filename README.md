# MATLAB_MovingBallVelocity
A small MATLAB program I made to take two images a specific amount of time apart in the same testing environment (more in the project files about this), MATLAB will determine where the moving object, in this case a tennis ball is and calculate it's velocity. It also comes with a little demo to show that the program detected the object correctly for the user, but primary function is just to output velocity on 2D axis of a moving object to run further calculations with. I did this as a final project for a Digital Image Course at college, and because it was academic it's definitely free for anyone to use and should by no means ever be sold or behind a paywall of any kind. Hope this helps someone out there!
