# MATLAB_MovingBallVelocity
A small MATLAB program I made to take two images a specific amount of time apart in the same testing environment (more in the project files about this), MATLAB will determine where the moving object, in this case a tennis ball is and calculate it's velocity. It also comes with a little demo to show that the program detected the object correctly for the user, but primary function is just to output velocity on 2D axis of a moving object to run further calculations with. I did this as a final project for a Digital Image Course at college, and because it was academic it's definitely free for anyone to use and should by no means ever be sold nor behind a paywall of any kind. Hope this helps someone out there!

# Instructions:
Two ways to use it, fastest way is to use tennisballVelocity.m by calling tennisballVelocity method and which takes the parameters filepath1, filepath2, timePassed as Strings. This method just spits out the velocity in a 1x2 vector where the first element is x velocity, and second element is the y velocity. (-) means left if x, and down if y respectively. The second way is to just run vOfTennisballDemo.m script which will use ui to prompt for info and give a figure at the end with markup objects and small printout message box to compare it with that will tell you where it found the ball in the images, centoid locations and velocity.
